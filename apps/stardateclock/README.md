# Stardate Clock

A clock face displaying a stardate along with a "standard" digital/analog clock
in LCARS design.

That design has been made popular by various Star Trek shows. Credits for the
original LCARS designs go to Michael Okuda, copyrights are owned by Paramount Global,
usage of that type of design is permitted freely for non-profit use cases.
The Bangle.js version has been created by Robert Kaiser <kairo@kairo.at>.

The stardate concept used leans on the shows released from the late 80s onward
by using 1000 units per Earth year, but to apply this more cleanly, this split
is applied exactly. Also, to give more relationship to the shows and
incidentally make values look similar to those depicted there, the zero point
is set to the first airing of the original 'Star Trek' series in the US on
Thursday, September 8, 1966, at 8:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

The clock face supports Bangle.js 1 and 2 with some compromises (e.g. the
colors will look best on Bangle.js 1, the font sizes will look best on
Bangle.js 2).

Any tap on the diaply while unlocked switches the "standard" Earth-style clock
between digital and analog display.
